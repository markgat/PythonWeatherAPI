# Weather Analysis
Using the OpenWeatherMap API, this application creates random samples of global weather data, and plots their behaviour across latitudes and the equator. With a quick glimpse, we examine weather the temperature is warmer along the equator.

## Getting Started
### Preparation
1) On the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) site, create an account. Once logged in, click on your username at the top of the page, then "API keys" to display your personal API key. We will be using this when running the application.
### Installing
1) Git clone the repository to your local machine:
    ````
    $ git clone  https://github.com/markgat/PythonWeatherAPI.git
    ````
## Running
1) Within: ````/code/api_keys.py```` enter your API key.
2) Afterwards, create a terminal within the directory of the local repository, and enter the command ````jupyter notebook```` with a "y".
3) When the new page loads, locate ````code/WeatherPy.ipynb```` and open it
4) From here, you can run the blocks one-by-one by selecting the first block and clicking "Run" on top to see the process of analytics, or selecting "Cells" from the top bar and then "Run All" to see it execute all at once.
5) To shutdown, select "Quit" on a Jupyter Webpage.
